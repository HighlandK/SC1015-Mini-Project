# Handwritten Digit Classification with MNIST Dataset

## Overview

This project is an in-depth exploration into image recognition with a primary focus on the classification of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Leveraging various machine learning models, we aim to demonstrate the process of building, training, and evaluating models in a manner that's accessible to individuals at different stages of their data science journey.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset, a benchmark for machine learning models, comprises 70,000 images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale picture flattened into a 784-dimensional vector. Labels indicating the actual digit (0-9) accompany each image.

## Feature Engineering and Preprocessing

Our preprocessing routine involves:

- Normalizing pixel values to aid in model convergence.
- One-hot encoding of categorical labels for compatibility with model outputs.

## Machine Learning Models and Implementation

We have crafted a suite of Jupyter Notebooks to document the implementation and evaluation of the following algorithms:

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

We implement a neural network with a hyperbolic tangent activation and a softmax output layer, training it using stochastic gradient descent. Various architectures with different numbers of hidden units (32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024) are evaluated to understand the impact of model complexity on performance.

### Decision Tree

A Decision Tree Classifier is implemented with a focus on understanding the influence of depth on decision-making and overall accuracy. The model's decision process is visualized as a tree diagram.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN is chosen for its simplicity and efficacy in classification tasks. We assess the performance of the model by adjusting the number of neighbors.

### Logistic Regression

A multinomial Logistic Regression model demonstrates a fundamental approach to classification tasks and serves as a benchmark for other, more complex algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

The project kicks off with an extensive data analysis phase where we explore the dataset's characteristics. Visualization efforts include:

- Displaying random samples of digits.
- Plotting the average image for each digit class.
- Graphing frequency distributions and pixel intensity box plots.

## Training and Evaluation Metrics

Each model is rigorously trained and evaluated. Training progress is monitored through loss and accuracy curves. Post-training, models are evaluated on unseen test data with the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Recall
- Precision
- F1-Score

These metrics, derived from the classification report, offer insight into the generalizability and performance of each model.

## Results

The results section in each notebook offers a detailed account of the model's performance, with comparative analysis showcasing how complexity affects accuracy and overfitting tendencies.

## Contributions

Our collaborative effort reflects in each notebook, with clearly documented code, comments, and markdown cells explaining the rationale behind model choices and hyperparameters. Individual contributions are acknowledged where significant.
